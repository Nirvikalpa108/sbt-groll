This is the 1.0.0 release of [groll](http://github.com/hseeberger/groll/), a plugin for [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/) to view and navigate through the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) history.

Groll provides the command *groll* that provides various options to view and navigate through the Git history. Of course this means, that you can only use groll for projects using Git as version control system. If you are navigating through the Git history, groll will reload the sbt session if the build definition changed.

Example:

    > groll prev
    [info] Moved back to previous commit: 4244713 Use patterns to improve readability

The command *groll* must be followed by one of the following options:

- *show*: Shows the current commit id and message
- *list*: Shows all commits
- *next*: Moves to the next commit, reloading the sbt session if the build definition changed
- *prev*: Moves to the previous commit, reloading the sbt session if the build definition changed
- *head*: Moves to the head of the commit history, reloading the sbt session if the build definition changed
- *move*: Moves to the given commit, reloading the sbt session if the build definition changed

Please see the [README](http://github.com/hseeberger/groll/blob/master/README.rst) for information about installing and using groll.
